	<p><center>hi im gian, this sites webmaster :) this site is still a work in progress so expect various changes and missing links. this is where i test my css, html, and web design knowledge whenever i get random spurts of energy. i thought to myself why not try html and css stuff, so here i am. join me on my little journey to build a cute little oldschool website to support internet culture <br><br>
	  this site is probably never gonna be fully done, but i work on it almost everyday so check in every once in a while, i'd really appreciate it. <br><br> i hope all of you enjoy my silly little corner of the internet as much as i do.

	  <center> <h1>website info</h1> </center>
	  <p><center> made with html, css and unfortunately a little javascript. i'll probably add some more stuff down the line but i'll keep it as lightweight as possible</center>
